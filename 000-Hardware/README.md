# Introduction
Follow along as I transform my homelab setup and take it from sitting on a cheap shoe rack to a network rack.

Final product! I'm very happy with how it turned out, and it is much cleaner than my old setup.

There are still some improvements I am looking to make with this. First being the patch panel, I will upgrade with a full sized patch panel so it properly fits in this rack. Second, I will get a brushed rack mount to fit in between my switch and router so it covers that space but still allows me to run cables.

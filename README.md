# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Home Lab

This repository is all about a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab built to simulate real-world security operations. It runs on a Proxmox VE infrastructure and integrates multiple tools, including Wazuh, Security Onion, Pi-hole, n8n, Tenable Nessus, Kali Linux, and more. The lab is designed for hands-on practice in monitoring, detection, incident response, and automation.

All configurations, architectures, and findings are documented in Obsidian and synced with this repository for analysis and continuous learning.
